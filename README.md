# Docker Images

This repository contains a random assortment of customised Docker images. In most cases Im using them to host my own copies of these sites, but they should be generic enough to use elsewhere.

## Conscious Decisions I've made

* All docker images are based on Alpine 3.11 (unless there's already an app-specific container which Im just extending)
* I prefer PostgreSQL, so all images use that. IT should be trivial to edit to use MySQL (assuming the application supports it)
